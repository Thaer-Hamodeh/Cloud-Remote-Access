# Cloud-Remote-Access
I have created an instance on google cloud with Linux OS, installed python 3 on it and created the server.py file. Using SSH I can access my instance on the cloud. On my PC I have created the file client.py and when running this file the server will have full remote access to the command line at the client-side (my PC).
